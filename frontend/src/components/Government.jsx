            description: 'The main objective of PMJDY is to ensure that every Indian has access to basic financial services such as a savings account, debit card and insurance. This would help to curb financial exclusion and promote inclusive growth. PMJDY is also geared towards providing banking facilities to disadvantaged and marginalised sections of society, who receive benefits from various government schemes. Through direct benefits transfer, recipients will be able to receive financial assistance from the government without intermediaries, reducing corruption and increasing transparency. PMJDY accounts are zero-balance accounts and do not require any minimum balance to be maintained. This makes it easier for low-income groups and rural households to access banking services.',
